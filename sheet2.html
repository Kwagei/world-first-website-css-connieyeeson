            The <a href=""><i>WWW</i></a>
            project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an <br> easy but powerful global information system.
            
            The project is based on the philosphy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone. <br>
            It aims to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by support groups. <br>
            Originally aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted much interest in user support, resource discovery and
            collaborative work areas.

        <h2>
            Reader view
        </h2>
        <p>
            The WWW world consists of documents, and links. Indexes are special documents which, <br>
             rather than being read, may be searched. The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document containing links to the documents found.
             A sample protocol ("  <a href=""><i>HTTP</i></a> ") <br> is used to allow a browser  program to request a keyword search by a remote information server.



        </p>
        <p>
            The web contains documents in many formats. Those documents which are hypertext, <br>
            (real or virtual) contain links to other documents, or places within documents. All documents, <br> whether real, virtual or indexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within the same addressing scheme.

           <br> To follow a link, a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a number if he or she has no mouse). <br> To search and index, 
            a reader gives keywords (or other search criteria). <br>
             These are the only operations necessary to access the entire world of data.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Information provider view
        </h2>
        <p>
            The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via existing protocols (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway. <br> In this way, the critical mass of data is quickly exceeded, <br>
             and the increasing use of the system by readers and information suppliers encourage each other.
             Making a web is as simple as writing a few <a href=""><i>SGML</i></a> <br> files which point to your existing data. Making it public involves running the FTP or HTTP <a href=""> <i>daemon</i> </a>,

             another. In fact, any file available by anonymous FTP can be immediately linked into a web. <br> The very small start-up effort is designed to allow small contributions. <br>
              At the other end of the scale, large information providers may provide an HTTP server with full text or keyword indexing. <br>
              This may allow access to a large existing database without changing the way that database is managed. Such gateways have already been made into Digital's VMS/Help, <br>
              Technical Univerity of Graz's "Hyper-G", and Thinking Machine's "W.A.I.S." systems.

        <p>
            The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data format between suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of format between a smart browser and a smart server. <br>
             This should provide a basis for extension into multimedia, <br>
             and allow those who share application standards to make full use of them across the web.

            You can try the simple <a href=""> <i>line mode browser</i> </a> by telnetting to info.cern.ch (no user or password. From UK JANET, use the <a href=""><i>Gateway</i></a>). <br>
            sophisticated browser -- remember that the window-oriented ones are much smarter! <br>
            It is much more efficient to install a browser on your own machine. The line mode browser is currently available in source form by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] as <br>

            (v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)

        <p>

            Also available is a  <a href=""> <i>hypertext editor</i></a> for the NeXT (WWWNeXTStepEditor_v.vv.tar.Z),  the ViolaWWW browser for X11, and a skeleton server daemon (WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).
