        An FAQ list is really a cop-out from managed information. You should be able to find everything you want to know by browsing from the WWW project page, <br>
        as everything should be arranged in a logical way. Here though are things which maybe didn't fit into the structure,<br>
         with pointers to the answers which maybe did. Its an experiment, started May 92. The questioners are anonymous.
