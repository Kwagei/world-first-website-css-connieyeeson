         If you don't have World-Wide Web software yet, telnet to info.cern.ch (128.141.201.74), <br>

                 Three developments on the clients side. Tony Johnson of Boston University, <br>
                 developer of the <a href=""><i>MidasWWW</i></a> browser for Motif, has ported it now to four X11 platforms and has a tar file of sources available on ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src or <br>
                 ftp://freehep.scri.fsu.edu/freehep/networking_news_email/midaswww as midaswww_1.0.tar.Z Tony also has plans to include graphics and text editing in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here at CERN, Nicola Pellow is back until the end of the year, and has picked up the <a href=""><i>Mac Browser </i></a> . <br>
               She has a pre-alpha with basic functionality up, watch this space for the first release.
            </p>

            <p>
                The full-screen client (using curses) has been released by Jim Whitescarver of NJIT, see release note for details.
            </p>
            <p>
                The NeXTStep client has been revised. The 0.13 version generated bad SGML at times, <br>
                so anyone using it to write hypertext is advised to upgrade to 0.14 immediately. <br>
                The binary is in ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/next/WorldWideWeb_0.14.app.tar.Z

            <h2>
                More and more hypertext on line
            </h2>

            <p>
                New W3 servers have appeared at <a href=""><i>KVI</i></a> ad at <a href=""><i>CWI</i></a>  both in the Netherlands, <br>
                <a href=""><i>IN2P3</i></a> in France, and NCSA in Illinois, USA. KVI and IN2P3 are both High Energy Physics institites. <br>
                All the servers have local information as well as various other goodies. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                CWI has a hypertext version of the Gnu documentation and of a guide to <a href="mats"><i>Audios Formats</i></a> , <br>
                and <a href=""><i>INCSA</i></a>  has many things including hypertext documentation for the <a href=""><i>X-collage</i></a>  system. <br>
                Two CERN projects to produce online hypertext documentation recently are ADAMO and RD13.

            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile,<a href="school"><i>Cornell Law school </i></a>have a server with hypertext of US Copyright Law... <br>
                as law tends to be mostly cross-reference ("as defined in Sect1.2.2.(a) above") hypertext makes a lot of sense here!

            <h2>
                Browse the WAIS servers
            </h2>

            <p>
                It's sometimes been a bit difficult browsing through what there is in the WAIS world. <br>
                Now, looking for information under "types of server" on the web will lead you to hypertext lists 
                 of WAIS servers arranged by name of "source" and by internet domain. <br>
                These lists are generated automatically at CERN from TMC's catalogue. 
                 Clicking on the source name takes you directly to the index. Currently there are 310 databases on 88 hosts accesible.
